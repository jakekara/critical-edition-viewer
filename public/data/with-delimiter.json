Other,\nnon-religious aspects of traditional shtetl life also lingered, including\neconomic and social patterns that had existed for centuries. For example, most\nJews in Zvenigorodka, including Liubov’s father, maintained their traditional\nartisanal trades as cobblers, tailors, tinsmiths, etc. In an effort to build a\nsocialist economy, the Soviet state drove the collectivization of such artisans\ninto “artels.” However, within the highly concentrated Jewish population of the\nformer Pale of Settlement, these artels reinforced Jewish social circles and,\nby extension, traditional Jewish life. Furthermore, in its effort to rally\npopular support for the development of a socialist economy, the Soviet state\npursued a policy of “indigenization” in the 1920s, producing popular culture\nthat was “national in form, socialist in content.” Yiddish language theater\ntroupes and newspapers promulgated a linguistic and cultural Jewishness that\nappealed to secular and religious Jews alike. These cultural institutions, like\nthe Yiddish schools, were largely shuttered in the mid-late 1930s as the\nStalinist state asserted a more homogeneous Soviet culture. Nevertheless, their\nbrief existence produced a generation of Soviet Jews whose Jewish identity was\nsubstantively Jewish and profoundly Soviet.

In the initial months of the\noccupation, German operatives focused on eliminating potential sources of resistance,\nparticularly Communist party officials and other “radical” elements. While Nazi\npropaganda frequently employed the words “communist” and “Jew” interchangeably,\nthere was no policy yet for the annihilation of Jews. Instead, the German\noccupiers initially confined Jews to ghettos in or near their hometowns.\nAccording to Christopher Browning, between September 18 and October 25, 1941,\nthe Third Reich developed a comprehensive vision for the Final Solution, which\nwas later codified at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942.<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> This\nnew vision called for the construction of industrialized extermination centers\nin Poland to which Jews would be deported from across Europe.
