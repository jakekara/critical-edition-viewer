Despite the personal risk owing to the well-known hatred for Jews\namong certain Soviet partisans, Oshry reasoned, staying in a ghetto would mean exposing\noneself to murder (ghetto residents were popularly known as “easy kills”, he notes).\nEscaping to the forests, in contrast, entailed only a “possible danger” (<i>safek\nsakanah</i>), since those who resolved to escape were doubtless well-informed of\nthe whereabouts of sympathetic partisans. In fact, Oshry argued, the more Jews\nwho escaped to the forests and joined partisan camps, the more the German\n“Amalek” would be weakened. Therefore, “one should encourage and fortify them\nand extend them as much help as possible in obtaining weapons so that they will\nnot come empty-handed to the partisan camps and will be knowledgeable in battle\nand warfare and poised to be on the front lines at the head of the fighters.”<a href=\"#_ftn24\">[24]</a>"}},{"type":"footnoteParagraph","data":{"id":"_ftn24","label":"24","text":"\nEphraim Oshry, <i>Mi-ma’amakim </i>(NY, 1976), no. 10, pp. 73-9.
