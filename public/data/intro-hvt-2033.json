When Esther was a young adult aspiring\nto be a physician, however, she had to confront antisemitism in the form of the\n<i>numerus clausus</i>. This cap on the number of Jewish students able to\npursue medical education in Poland, combined with limits on women’s enrollment\nin Polish medical schools, forced her to turn elsewhere for her professional\neducation: France.
